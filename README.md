## About Pet Search
Pet Search is an application that allows users to search for adoptable pets in a location of their choosing.  The user can search by ZIP Code, a mile radius of their choosing, and the type of pets searchable pulled in by data from the API.  After the user searches, they can filter down their selection by age, sex, and size.  The user can clear any or all filters at the tap of a button, as well as create a new search at the top and bottom of the page.  Once the user has pets displayed, they will see a picture of the pets returned, as well as some basic information on that pet (if provided) like name, city location, age, and breed of the animal.  If the user chooses, they can click the "More Info" link under the pets descritpion to get even more details about the animal like more pictures, shelter contact information, and a detailed descritpion about the pet.  

## Technology
Pet Search is powered by the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery
